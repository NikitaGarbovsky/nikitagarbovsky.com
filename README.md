# My Webpage
Disclaimer:
This webpage is always being added to and is currently still in development.

This is my currently working and launched webpage used by myself to show my latest projects and interests. Contact me through any of the contacts listed on my site.

# Main goals with this site:

My goal with this site is to provide a central access point for my information, contactability and latest projects to any and all that are interested.

Current implementations to add are:

~~1. Rewrite and restructure external CSS to accompany the future blog, projects, about and contact page.~~
2. Create dropdown boxes for the navigation bar list, showing multiple options when moused over each list item respectively.
3. Create a preview screen on the home page below the picture content and introductory paragraphs once more projects have been started! This will display current projects and updates to my current projects.
